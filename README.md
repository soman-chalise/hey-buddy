## 🧪 How to Run the Project

download the zip file from here --> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uebjRkfL3rXRkdGpW6AaCQFbWsrY44KI?usp=sharing
extract the zip file in desktop there you will get a folder named groq_ai_assistent 
inside the folder there is a .env file paste your api key over there (eg: GROQ_API_KEY="your api key")
inside the folder there is another folder hey_buddy
inside hey_buddy folder there is a hey_buddy.exe
double click the exe (dont get impatent and click multiple time) and wait for 2-3 min it will automatically setup everything
run the server.exe to access screenpipe terminator features (ui interaction , opeaning apps etc)
and everything is set 
say "hey buddy"  if a popup appears in the bottom right corner then everything is done correctly
check out the ppt or the demo video for all the features

## 🏁 Final Words

Hey-Buddy is the result of intense iteration, late nights, and a clear vision:  
to build a voice-first assistant that actually feels useful — not just a toy demo.

The original plan was to combine:
- 🤖 **Groq** for reasoning  
- 🖥️ **ScreenPipe** for system control  
- 🌊 **Fluvio** for real-time event streaming

But I faced major challenges trying to integrate Fluvio:
- The SDK lacked proper Windows support
- I spent nearly **5 full days** trying to get it working locally

In the end, I had to make a tough call and **ditch Fluvio** to focus on delivering a working, polished experience powered by Groq and ScreenPipe. I’m proud of that decision — and the result is a fully working  assistant that feels smooth, smart, and snappy.

This project was built entirely solo — every line of code, every bug crushed, every feature tested and tuned.  
And I hope when you say "Hey Buddy" — it feels like you’re talking to something that was built with care.

Big thanks to the organizers, Groq, and ScreenPipe for the platform to bring this to life 🙌
